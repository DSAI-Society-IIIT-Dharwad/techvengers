USAGE EXAMPLES:
Load batch models:
  analyzer = NetworkTrafficAnalyzer('data.csv')
  analyzer.load_models()  # Uses saved models
  alerts = analyzer.detect_anomalies()

Load streaming models:
  processor = StreamingPacketProcessor()
  processor.load_models()  # Uses saved models
  processor.start_processing()

Manage models:
  python model_manager.py  # List and test models
